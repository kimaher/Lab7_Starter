Q1 : 1 - Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because it makes it easier to maintain the code and fix errors by limiting human error and having working shared branches.

Q2 : No, way too slow.

Q3 : Navigation mode loads the full page and tests the entire page performance while snapshot mode is much faster and tests without reloading the page. This means snapshot mode is useful for component testing or partial states.

Q4 : To improve the website we could properly size images and potentially save 864 KiB. We could preconnect to the required resource fakestoreapi to save 140ms of time. Lastly, we could serve images in next-gen formats to potentially save 165 KiB of space.
